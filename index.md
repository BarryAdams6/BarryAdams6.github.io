## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 9
  
  My first favorite lab is Lab 9 because it taught us to translate different types of codes and introduced us to how we can use the shell commands and write the codes to help read from each of the files. Once the file has been read, we also use code to write to the file. We also learned certain codes that are required to handle I/O errors. I liked this because it was a very interesting lab.

* Lab 10
  
  My next favorite lab is Lab 10. We wrote the codes using 2D vectors and using certain units to help test and write down function definitions using the git clang formatting tools. the unit testing helped with the overall project. We also filled in definitions of the certain functions that belongs to the code of the command module. This way you will be able to figure out how to place the certain sections of where the code is supposed to go, and organize the command module to get it to its proper form. I liked this module because it involved certain types of graphics.

* Lab 12
   
  My last favorite lab is Lab 12. In this lab we used certain command codes to help create an animated image. We learned to make sure that we are properly placing the codes in the right place so that once we apply it our image will turn out exactly the way we want it to. We also wrote code that used library functions and created random numbers. I like this module because it taught us how to create our own animation image.
