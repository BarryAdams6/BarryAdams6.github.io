## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
Lab 9 
My first favorite lab is Lab 9 because it taught us to translate different types of codes and introduced us to how we can use the shell commands and write the codes to help read from each of the files. Once the file has been read, you must also then write down those certain codes that are required to handle I/O errors to help build up shell commands. This way it will help us figure it out when we are formatting the code. 

Lab 10 
My next favorite lab is Lab 10. We wrote the codes using 2D vectors and using certain units to help test and write down function definitions using the git clang formatting tools. We also filled in the certain function that belongs to the code of the command module when we are typing it out. This way you will be able to figure out how to place the certain sections of where the code is supposed to go. That way we can try to organize the command module to get it to its proper form. These are certain commands that help organize these codes.

Lab 12  
My last favorite lab is Lab 12. In this lab we used certain command codes to help create an animated image. We also learned to make sure that we are properly placing the codes in the right place so that once we apply it our image will turn out exactly the way we want it to. If we misplace or put the code in the wrong direction of the command pattern, the animation may not turn out the way that we want it to.
